# Conway's game of life
Multiple Python 3 implementations of Conway's game of life

This repository will hold two different implementations of the famous [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

The 'functional' programming code is based on the code examples from the book **Head First Learn to Code**

Once the functional implementation is running, I'm planning on adding my own using Object Oriented Programming as an exercise in OOP.
